# interaction_bot
ESP's random interaction bot!

To set up:
* clone repository locally
* add a `.env` file with the bot token and the server name
* create a venv
    * use pip to install `discord.py` and `python-dotenv`

To run:
* Enter the venv
* Run `python3 -u bot.py >> log.txt &`
* Close the shell, and let it run!


Doesn't work on python 3.4.3. Works on 3.6.9. Not sure what minimum version is necessary.
